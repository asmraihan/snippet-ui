## Introduction

__Snippet UI is NOT a component library.__ It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

It is built with TypeScript and React and Next, and is designed to be easy to use and extend.


## What do you mean by not a component library?

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

__Pick the components you need.__ Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.

Use this as a reference to build your own component libraries.


This library is heavily inspired by [https://ui.shadcn.com](https://ui.shadcn.com),  [https://tx.shadcn.com](https://tx.shadcn.com).
